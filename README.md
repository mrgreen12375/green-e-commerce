# green-e-commerce

## Description
This project is to create an e-commerce back end using a working express.js api and configure it to use Sequelize to interact with a mysql database. I defined the columns in the models for the seed information. I created GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE routes for the category routes, product routes, and tag routes. After creating the schema using mysql I seeded the data using npm run seed and to run the server npm start. I then ran a demo of the routes using insomnia. In insomnia I was able to show how to GET all the sections or GET just 1 section by id. I was able to POST a new section to the database and do a PUT to update a section. In the end I was able to DELETE all of the changes I had made.
